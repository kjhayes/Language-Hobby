Structure Types Denoted With Commas:

int a, int b, short x //struct{int a, int b, short x}

Names for individual members is not necessary, this syntax can be used to access each member:

    myStruct: int, int

Functions Have a Single Return Type and Single Argument Type, No Parenthesis For Function Calls:

with structs being denoted by commas this can look really nice.

MyFunc: int x, int, int -> double, double = {

};
